Threshold recommendation based on Activities of Daily Living (ADL)

Description
-----------
'Threshold' refers to a time value _t_. Currently, alerts are triggered based on fixed _t_ values that apply to all elderly residents.
To improve accuracy as well as decrease the false alarm rate, this project seeks to reccomend thresholds for each elderly resident based
on their ADL. The current acceptable false alarm rate is 7/50 (0.14) residents per month.
